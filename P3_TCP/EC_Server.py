Title: EC_Server.py
Description: Extra Credit Assignment. This server will act as the processing 
relay between to clients. That is, this server will receive two connections
from two different clients. Each client will then send a message to the other 
client via the server. Example Client X wants to send  message to Client Y. To
do so it has to go through the server first (X -> S -> Y)
